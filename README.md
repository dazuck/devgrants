# Ceramic Prizes

Ceramic Ecosystem Prizes connects bounty funders with builders and researchers adding value to the Ceramic and Web3 communities. 

## Prize Types

### Bounty
Bounties are monetary awards for completing eligible projects in the Ceramic ecosystem. Bounties are paid upon completion of a pre-defined spec and acceptance criteria. 

[**LIST OF BOUNTIES**](../../projects/1) • [**CLAIM A BOUNTY**](BOUNTIES.md#how-to-collect) • [**START A BOUNTY**](BOUNTIES.md#how-to-propose) • [Read More](BOUNTIES.md)

To claim a bounty, simply submit a patch addressing the issue &mdash; no other proposal or pre-approval is required. Once the PR is merged, you can claim the bounty. You can also offer a bounty by following the steps in [Bounties: How to Propose](BOUNTIES.md#how-to-propose).

### Community Funding
Do you have an idea for pushing the Ceramic ecosystem forward? Community Funding is available to support novel ideas that advance the ecosystem. We can also conect project seeking funding to investors looking to support the Ceramic ecosystem.

### RFPs
Projects too large for a bounty are specified as RFPs and can range from more complex feature work  to entirely new tools and libraries. 

To see open RFPs and learn more about the proposal process see [RFPs](rfps). RFPs may be funded by 3Box Labs, other community members, or a consortium of interested parties.
